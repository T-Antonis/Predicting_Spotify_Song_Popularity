# Predicting Spotify Song Popularity

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between features and song's popularity and the classification of Spotify tracks into two popularity categories using machine learning methods. 
Multiple models were trained and compared, with emphasis on interpretability and robustness across different data splits.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Training and comparison of multiple ML models
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluation using F1-score, precision, recall, and confusion matrices
- Final selection of the best-performing model 
- Which attributes affect the popularity of a track
